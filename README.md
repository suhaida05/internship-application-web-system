# internship-application-web-system
The starting page is designated as index.php. <br>
In this system, there are two user roles: the applier and the admin. To log in as an admin, click on 'STAF' on the index.php page. For applicants, simply click 'Login'. <br>
I've also included the 'intern.sql' table in the 'table' folder. <br>
I hope you can successfully execute the system.
